Simply Recipes / Lori Rice

There's no better way to welcome a new season than with the classic foods that showcase its bounty, and these springy recipes do
just that. From spring vegetable minestrone to lamb stew, rhubarb cobbler to carrot cake, these are the recipes I make every year
to celebrate the return of spring's bright, fresh flavors.


 * EASY CARROT CAKE LOAF [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/carrot-cake-loaf-recipe-8611080]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm

   "Grate carrots fresh at home using the coarse side of a box grater or a food processor. Save those prepackaged shredded carrots
   for salads. They're shredded too thick and are much drier, which translates to a dry cake with still-crunchy carrots." —Mark
   Beahm, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * SPRING MINESTRONE SOUP [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/spring_minestrone_soup/]
   
   
   Elise Bauer
   Get Recipe
   
   "You can either make fresh pesto [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/fresh_basil_pesto/] for this recipe or buy some
   high-quality pesto in the market, just don't skip it!" —Hank Shaw, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * RHUBARB FOOL [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/rhubarb_fool/]
   
   
   Sally Vargas
   Get Recipe
   
   "I like to add a little sour cream to the whipped cream in my fools — it gives the dessert some tang and also helps stabilize
   the cream to keep it from weeping." —Sally Vargas, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * SHRIMP AND ASPARAGUS PASTA [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/shrimp-and-asparagus-pasta-recipe-5270014]
   
   
   
   Alison Bickel / Simply Recipes
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "While there are many ways you can enjoy your early spring asparagus, one of my favorites is to pair it with shrimp in a
   simple, weeknight-friendly pasta dish. The asparagus’ sweet, vegetal profile compliments the shrimp’s slightly sweet flavor,
   and both ingredients have a similar tender but toothsome texture." —Georgia Freedman, Recipe Developer

 * EGGS MIMOSA WITH ARTICHOKE TAPENADE [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/eggs_mimosa_with_artichoke_tapenade/]
   
   
   Elise Bauer
   Get Recipe
   
   "We are using canned artichoke hearts that have been packed in water. You could also use freshly cooked artichoke hearts. Just
   avoid the artichoke hearts that are packed in a marinade; those would overwhelm this dish." —Elise Bauer, Founder
   
   


 * STRAWBERRY SPOON CAKE [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/strawberry-spoon-cake-recipe-8657571]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "I’m loyal to the recipe as is, but I suppose you could add spices to the batter, like cinnamon, vanilla, or cardamom, if your
   heart desires it." —Myo Quinn, Contributor
   
   


 * GREEN GODDESS PASTA SALAD [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/green-goddess-pasta-salad-recipe-5324251]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Lori Rice
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "Add a can or two of drained canned white beans for more protein—perfect for when you’re serving it as a vegan main meal."
   —Devan Grimsrud, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * CLASSIC RACK OF LAMB [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/classic_rack_of_lamb/]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "When choosing lamb at the butcher's, look for meat that is pink or rosy red. Any meat that is a darker red is showing signs of
   age and won't be as tender. Look for firm white fat and pink meat that is fine grained." —Elise Bauer, Founder

 * SPRING VEGETABLE SALAD WITH ASPARAGUS, PEAS AND RADISHES

   Alison Bickel
   Get Recipe
   
   "English peas can be sweet or a little starchy. It’s best to pop a few out of their pod and give them a taste. If they’re good
   and tender, add them raw to any salad. If the peas are a touch starchy, shell them and blanch briefly in boiling water, shock
   in ice water, then drain." —Katie Morford, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * EDNA LEWIS’ 2-INGREDIENT SKILLET SCALLIONS [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/edna-lewis-skillet-scallions-review-8622172]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Stephanie Ganz
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "Skillet scallions are an easy side dish that go well with a wide variety of dishes. I love it as a complement to roast chicken
   [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/simple-roast-chicken-recipe-7866976] or whole roasted trout, but it’s also a nice choice for a
   meal of all veggies." —Stephanie A. Ganz, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * EASY CHICKEN PRIMAVERA [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/easy-chicken-primavera-recipe-8611808]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Mihaela Kozaric Sebrek
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "If you can't find cavatappi pasta, you can substitute it out for another type of pasta, just make sure to look for a type that
   has a 6 to 8-minute cook time." —Melissa Gray, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * GRILLED ASPARAGUS [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/grilled_asparagus/]
   
   
   Elise Bauer
   Get Recipe
   
   "Thick asparagus work best for grilling; get the chubbiest spears you can. Thin spears will dry out before they get a good
   char." —Elise Bauer, Founder

 * JOANNA GAINES' EASY LEMON BUNDT CAKE [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/joanna-gaines-lemon-bundt-cake-review-8620674]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Sara Haas 
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "The recipe begins with prepping a 12-cup bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray or butter, but I prefer shortening because
   it's easier to spread in all of the pan's nooks and crannies and ensures that the cake releases easily from the pan." —Sara
   Haas, Recipe Developer
   
   


 * FENNEL SLAW WITH MINT VINAIGRETTE [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/fennel_slaw_with_mint_vinaigrette/]
   
   
   Elise Bauer
   Get Recipe
   
   "The sugar helps bring out the natural sweetness of the fennel, don't leave out!" —Elise Bauer, Founder
   
   


 * EASY GREEN PASTA [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/easy-pasta-with-winter-greens-recipe-5207178]
   
   
   Alison Bickel
   Get Recipe
   
   "Any pasta shape will work here. My preference is for fat, fun shapes like rigatoni, but the smooth texture of the sauce works
   with many shapes like orecchiette, pappardelle, and spaghetti. It’s also a fun choice for gnocchi or even cheese ravioli."
   —Laurel Randolph, Associate Editorial Director

   Simply Recipes / Irvin Lin
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "For most folks, strawberry rhubarb pie is the immediate go-to dessert. Although I adore that classic pie, making a crisp is
   not only significantly easier, but it allows you to serve it to a larger group of people—everyone can scoop out as much as they
   want!" —Irvin Lin, Recipe Developer

   "If you're not a fan of cottage cheese, don't fret. It melts into the surrounding eggs and other ingredients, and just make it
   all taste good." —Elise Bauer, Founder

   "Got a Parmesan rind in your fridge? Add it when you pour in the broth. It will season the soup nicely as it simmers. Remove
   the rind just before serving." —Katie Morford, Recipe Developer

   Annika Panikker

   "This recipe makes great cupcakes! The cupcakes bake for about the same time as the cake, and you can double check by inserting
   a toothpick in the center." —Steve-Anna Stephens, Recipe Developer

   Sally Vargas
   Get Recipe
   
   "Unlike larger artichokes, more parts of these small ones are edible. You don't have to scoop out the choke, you can eat it
   with the rest of the heart and tender leaves.You can also simmer the discarded leaves in water for an hour to make an artichoke
   vegetable stock for soup, so nothing goes to waste." —Elise Bauer, Founder
   
   


 * NETTLE SOUP [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/nettle_soup/]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "The most classic way to serve nettles is in nettle soup, made with potatoes, stock, and a little cream. Luxurious and vibrant
   green, this soup is a bowl-licker." Elise Bauer, Founder
   
   


 * STRAWBERRY RHUBARB COBBLER [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/strawberry_rhubarb_cobbler/]
   
   
   
   Simply Recipes / Elise Bauer
   
   Get Recipe
   
   "The cobbler as written is pretty tart; if you prefer a sweeter cobbler you may want to take up the sugar a notch, perhaps
   another 1/4 to 1/2 cup." —Elise Bauer, Founder
   
   


 * SPRING LAMB STEW [https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/spring_lamb_stew/]
   
   
   Elise Bauer
   Get Recipe
   
   "I did this for supper last night and 3 of us ate the whole recipe. Wonderful change up to stew using fresh springs
   ingredients. Could not get my hands on green garlic so I substituted leek and some ramps." —Jamie, Simply Recipes Reader
